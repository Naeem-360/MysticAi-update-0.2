## ðŸš€ Update v1.2 â€“ Smarter Command Processing & Debugging  

### ðŸ”¹ Major Fixes & Improvements  

### âœ… Preserved Original Command for Extraction  
**Problem:**  
Fuzzy matching (`best_match = get_best_match(cleaned_command)`) was overwriting the original command, causing missing song names and topics (e.g., `"play shape of you"` became just `"play"`).  

**Fix:**  
- No longer reassigning `command = best_match`.  
- The **original input** is now used for extracting song names and topics.  

**Impact:**  
- Fixes prompts like *"What song would you like to play?"* when the song name is missing.  
- Ensures phrases like *"quantum physics"* are not lost.

### ðŸ”„ Improved Replace Logic  
**Problem:**  
Using `command.replace("play", "")` and `command.replace("explain", "")` **removed all occurrences** of these words, potentially corrupting user input.  

**Fix:**  
- Now replaces **only the first occurrence** using:  
  ```python
  command.replace("play", "", 1)
  command.replace("explain", "", 1)
